# **YGG Game Jam 2024**
### **Team Name**: Team Liempo Tim 	
### **Project Name**: DragonLitz						

## **Introduction**
DragonLitz is a 2D-medieval fantasy game where players collect, train, and battle dragons while exploring the world and completing quests. We decided on the name DragonLitz because the main NFT of the game are dragons hence, Dragon in the name. And Litz because the word “lit” is a popular slang that means exciting or popular since we want the game to pop off with the younger generation. Also it’s close to “bits” which refers to digital technology, blockchain or pixels, which is the main point of the game we’re making. 

## **Core Features**
- NFT: Dragons are the NFT. The dragons in the game all have unique stats, abilities, rarity, and aesthetics 
- Cryptocurrency: LitzCoin(Depends on the blockchain used) would be the cryptocurrency used in the game. They can be earned through the Player-versus-Player(PvP) mode.
- Player-versus-Environment(PvE) mode: In this mode, players can earn special relics or equipment for their dragons in order to boost stats.
- Player-versus-Player(PvP) mode: In this mode, players battle with other players in a competitive, turn-based strategy game. The game would provide incentives for the players to participate in the PvP events with rewards such as rare NFTs and/or cryptocurrency.
- Dragon Nest: This is where players can combine their dragons to make a new dragon in the form of an egg.
- Mythical Market: This is where players can buy, sell, and trade their dragons, equipment, and relics to other players which would use a blockchain (we haven’t decided which blockchain to use yet)
