Introduction
DragonLitz is a game where players collect, train, and battle dragons while exploring the world and completing quests. The dragons in the game all have unique stats, abilities, rarity, and aesthetics because they are the NFTs for this game. The game would have two modes: Player-versus-Environment(PvE) and Player-versus-Player(PVP). PvE mode is where the players will explore the world of DragonLitz and complete quests to gain items and dragons. On the other hand, PvP mode is where they will battle it out against other players in order to get rewards.
